            <h2>What is Assembly Language?</h2>
            <p>Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine code. It provides a symbolic representation of the machine instructions and data needed to program a specific CPU architecture.</p>
            <p>Unlike high-level languages like HTML or Python, assembly language is specific to the hardware architecture it targets and allows programmers to have direct control over the hardware resources.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 100px;">Basics</h2>
            <p>To begin your journey into assembly language programming, you'll need an understanding of the basic concepts and tools. Let's get started!</p>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Step 1: Understanding Assembly Language Structure</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <p>Assembly language programs consist of instructions that are mnemonic representations of machine-level operations. These instructions are typically organized into sections and are executed sequentially by the CPU.</p>
                <p>Here's a simple example of an assembly language program:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre><code>
    section .text
        global _start
    
    _start:
        mov eax, 4      ; syscall number for sys_write
        mov ebx, 1      ; file descriptor 1 (stdout)
        mov ecx, msg    ; address of the message to print
        mov edx, len    ; length of the message
        int 0x80        ; invoke the kernel
    
        mov eax, 1      ; syscall number for sys_exit
        xor ebx, ebx    ; exit code 0
        int 0x80        ; invoke the kernel
    
    section .data
    msg db 'Hello, World!', 0xa    ; the message to print
    len equ $ - msg                 ; calculate the length of the message
    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Step 2: Writing Assembly Code</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <p>Writing assembly code involves using mnemonic instructions and operands to perform operations such as arithmetic calculations, memory manipulation, and control flow.</p>
                <p>Assembly code is typically written using a text editor and saved with a specific file extension, such as .asm. Once written, the code must be assembled into machine code using an assembler program.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Step 3: Assembling and Executing Assembly Programs</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <p>After writing your assembly code, you'll need to assemble it into machine code using an assembler program specific to your CPU architecture. The resulting machine code can then be executed directly by the CPU.</p>
                <p>Most assembly language development environments provide tools for assembling and debugging assembly code, allowing you to test and refine your programs.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Step 4: Testing Your Assembly Code</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px;">
                <p>Once your assembly code is assembled into machine code, you can test it by executing the resulting binary file on your target hardware or using a simulator program.</p>
                <p>Testing and debugging are essential parts of the development process, helping to ensure that your assembly code functions correctly and efficiently.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Step 5: Further Learning and Resources</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 25px;">
